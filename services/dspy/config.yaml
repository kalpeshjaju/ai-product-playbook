# DSPy Prompt Optimization Configuration
#
# WHY: Controls the teacher/student models, trial count, and quality threshold
#      for automated prompt optimization (Playbook §20).
# HOW: Read by optimize.py at startup. Teacher model generates demonstrations,
#      student model is the target for the optimized prompt.

# Teacher model — generates high-quality demonstrations for few-shot
# Uses LiteLLM model aliases (must match services/litellm/config.yaml)
teacher_model: "claude-sonnet"

# Student model — the target model for the optimized prompt
# Typically a cheaper/faster model that benefits from optimization
student_model: "claude-haiku"

# Number of optimization trials to run
num_trials: 10

# Minimum quality metric score to promote a prompt
# Prompts scoring below this threshold are not POSTed to the API
metric_threshold: 0.8

# Maximum bootstrapped demonstrations per optimized prompt
max_bootstrapped_demos: 4

# Maximum labeled demonstrations per optimized prompt
max_labeled_demos: 8
