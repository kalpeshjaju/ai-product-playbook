# Architecture Decisions

> Record every non-trivial technical choice. Future LLMs read this before implementing.
> Format: ACTIVE decisions are followed. SUPERSEDED decisions are historical context only.

## How to Use This File

1. **Before implementing**: Read all ACTIVE decisions
2. **When making a choice**: Add a new entry here BEFORE coding
3. **When reversing a choice**: Mark old entry SUPERSEDED, add new ACTIVE entry
4. **Decision IDs**: Sequential (DEC-001, DEC-002, etc.)

## ACTIVE Decisions

<!-- Add decisions as they're made. Example:

### DEC-001: [Title] [ACTIVE]
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Author**: [LLM or human]
**Status**: ACTIVE

**Problem**: [What question needed answering]
**Options considered**:
1. [Option A] — [pros/cons]
2. [Option B] — [pros/cons]

**Decision**: [What we chose]
**Reason**: [Why]
**Consequences**: [Trade-offs accepted]

## SUPERSEDED Decisions

<!-- Moved here when a decision is reversed. Keep for historical context. -->
