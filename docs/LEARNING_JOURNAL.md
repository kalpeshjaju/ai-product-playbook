# Learning Journal

> **MANDATORY READ before every implementation task.**
> Every LLM must scan at minimum the Anti-Pattern Registry (bottom) before starting work.
> After implementation: add entry if you encountered failures, workarounds, or non-obvious solutions.

## Entries

<!-- Add entries as work happens. Format:

## YYYY-MM-DD: [Task Name]

**What happened**: [What was built]
**What worked**: [Successful approaches]
**What failed**: [Failed attempts + why]
**Lesson learned**: [Key insight]
**Next time**: [How to improve]

## Anti-Pattern Registry

> Quick-reference table. Add a row when you discover a new anti-pattern.

| Anti-Pattern | What Goes Wrong | Prevention | Date Added |
|-------------|----------------|------------|------------|
| Deploy from local CLI | Wrong directory gets deployed | Git-based deploy only (push to main) | 2026-02-28 |
| Skip learning journal | Same mistakes repeated across sessions | Read last 50 lines before every task | 2026-02-28 |
| Modify code without reading it first | Hallucinated APIs, phantom imports | Read file before editing | 2026-02-28 |
