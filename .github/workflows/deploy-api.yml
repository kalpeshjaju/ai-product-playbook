# FILE PURPOSE: Post-deploy smoke test for API on Railway
#
# WHY: Railway auto-deploys from git push to main (git-based deploy).
#      This workflow runs release guard checks and post-deploy health verification.
# HOW: On push to main, runs release guard, waits for Railway build, then smoke tests.
